description: >
  I solder PCBs regularly. Every time I try to use flux, it's awkward.
  I push the syringe to get a certain amount, but it keeps feeding flux
  even after I stop pressing, wasting product and making a mess.
  I am also cheap and don't like the liquid flux option. Therefore,
  I designed this mechanical dispenser.
